The Principal will notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal request. If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension for the review. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. After exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal. However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \"claimant\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy. The Principal will pay for any such autopsy. Article 7 - Legal Action Legal action to recover benefits under this Group Policy may not be started earlier than 90 days after required proof of loss has been filed and before the appeal procedures have been exhausted. Further, no legal action may be started later than three years after that proof is required to be filed.

Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal.
