If you miss a premium payment, your insurance policy typically provides a grace period of 30 days to make the payment without incurring penalties. During this grace period, your coverage remains active. However, if you do not make the payment within this timeframe, your policy may lapse, resulting in the loss of coverage. After a lapse, you may have the option to reinstate your policy, which often requires you to provide proof of insurability and pay any overdue premiums.
